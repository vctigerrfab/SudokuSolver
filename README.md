# SudokuSolver
Interactive Sudoku solver using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Leverages backtracking to solve puzzles, offering a user-friendly interface for input and solution display. Great for learning backtracking and building web-based puzzle games!

#Sudoku Solver with Backtracking Algorithm
This project implements a Sudoku solver using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The solving logic employs the backtracking algorithm, a powerful technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku.

//Features
Interactive Sudoku grid for user input.
Solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm.
Clear user interface for easy interaction.
//Getting Started

Using the Solver
Input: Enter numbers (1-9) in the empty cells of the Sudoku grid.
Solve: Click the "Solve" button to initiate the backtracking algorithm.
Output: If the puzzle has a unique solution, the missing numbers will be filled automatically. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
Technology Stack
Frontend:
HTML: Structure the web page content.
CSS: Style the visual elements of the interface.
JavaScript: Implement the Sudoku logic and user interaction.
Backtracking Algorithm
The project utilizes the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. This technique systematically assigns values to empty cells, backtracking when an invalid placement is encountered. It continues exploring possibilities until a solution is found or all paths are exhausted, indicating an unsolvable puzzle.
